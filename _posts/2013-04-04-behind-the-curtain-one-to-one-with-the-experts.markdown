There is one topic that people often raise when I am explaining my concept of the [Old Days vs the Internet](http://avastmick.org/old-days-vs-the-internet/); they bring to the discussion the subject of _Expert Advice._ People are increasingly realising that in the Old Days much of our behaviour was determined by experts and their opinion. However, today we are more able to choose more freely (for good or ill) the sources of our advice._ _

In a [previous post](http://avastmick.org/2013/03/05/what-the-butler-sees/) I (obtusely) discuss why you would engage expert advice for a given course of action and the potential pitfalls of doing so. But I think there is much more to the topic of _Experts_ than just whether you take their advice (or pay for it) or not.

The Internet changed our relationship with _Expert Advice_. My friend Steffen gave it eloquently as, "The Internet ignores advice weighting. In an Internet discussion an expert, say a doctor, is awarded the same value as any other participant. They are weighted 1:1."

Let's take a scenario. Say you were in the doctor's surgery. In the waiting room there were 20 people. You gave your symptoms to everyone in the room and asked their diagnosis. The doctor then came into this [crowd-sourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) medical session. Apart from being pretty upset at the undermining of his position, he would change the dynamic. We would (naturally) defer to his professional opinion. Even in the face of an opposed opinion. Who would you back? A doctor with years of training and erudition, or a room of (random for our purposes) people with uncertain medical qualification (maybe collated from medical drama and reality TV shows).

_You would take the advice of one person against that of 20 **every time**._

Now, say you were on the Internet seeking medical advice. The context has changed. You are not in a physical location known for medical matters, meeting with an individual unambiguously associated with the function of a doctor's surgery. No, you are at home, on your sofa, wine in hand, laptop on knees, worrying about that odd pain in the left-hand side of your chest that came on this afternoon (that's bad isn't it?).

You give your symptoms to everyone on the Internet (well, to Google - more on that later). In this "waiting room" there are millions of people, all willing to give you a diagnosis and prognosis (it's always cancer by the way, if you read for long enough). Faceless, unknown people that you have never met. All happy to share their knowledge, experience, opinions or just creative strangeness.

_This is one of the Internet's greatest strengths - the identity of people is uncertain **and you know**_** it.**

Given that you have no idea whether the people you are dealing with are real or whether they are who they say they are, you (wisely) treat them all equally. As Steffen says their opinion on average is weighted 1:1 by you.

Often, among these people are actual experts such as doctors and other medical practitioners. But sitting as you are on your sofa, wine in hand, you are removed from the context of trust that your doctor's surgery would give. There are two reasons that you do not take the advice of the first (or any) "doctor" you return from your Google search.

Firstly, "Who is this guy?" Given he is out of any comfortable context maybe he's some [Dr Nick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqImkDgDwHU) character, trolling the Internet for victims, dealing out quack diagnoses.

Secondly, in your doctor's surgery, your weren't there for advice, you were there for a cure. You would most likely only half listen to diagnosis while waiting for the prescription of drugs that would logically (in your mind) follow. On the Internet, where's the cure? All you'll be getting is a bunch of (worthless) opinions.

Due to these factors any medical practitioner participating in your online diagnosis is given the same weighting as anyone else, certainly anyone non-medical with _experience_ of your symptoms.

Okay, let me take stock here. What I am saying is that _Expert Advice_ is strictly accepted when provided in the traditional physical world, but toppled to the status of opinion on the Internet. This is a bad move surely, for the Internet to be so careless with the advice of experts? No. I don't think so.

The Old Days situation of implicit trust in experts (be they individuals or institutions) is being undermined, eroded by the freedom of information gained via the Internet. Cultural hegemony is increasingly harder to uphold by traditional institutions and hierarchies. Without sounding a pinko liberal Marxist, this is a good thing!

Why? Surely the dodgy advice _crowd sourced_ on the Internet cannot replace the accurate advice provided by professionals who have gained their learning through erudition and have received formal qualification. Generally no, I certainly wouldn't advocate that! However, crowd sourced opinion can give a valuable _counterpoint_ to the advice given by professional experts. In some cases it can overturn poor traditional thinking dressed up in pseudo-scientific garb.

Your local doctor often acts according to experience. At some point in time there was a body of considerable academic learning that was reinforced through practice. However, this could have been all years ago. Subsequently his efficiency as a medical practitioner is largely based on simpler heuristics, only dipping into more detailed learning (in books or journals) in cases that are out of the ordinary where his heuristics fail (if at all).

So, having an Internet crowd sourced diagnosis for your ailment may not be a bad idea: it will give you a ready second opinion in your mind while the doctor walks you through his version.

Back to an earlier point. Since you searched for the cause of your chest pain, your now notice curious adverts have appeared during your Internet sessions. Google want to sell you something based on your searched for ailment; or rather they want to advertise for their customers to pay for your searching. The real world is not always different.

Your doctor also wants to sell you something - the pharmaceutical industry incentivises him to sell you their drug treatments. Ethics notwithstanding this is a more precarious position that a lot of us would like to be in. Our crowd sourced second opinion may help us out, or at least reassure us that the advice given is good.

Back to the theme of my [previous post](http://avastmick.org/2013/03/05/what-the-butler-sees/). The Internet has given us a ready means of checking and sourcing _Expert Advice. _You need to take care in this world. Trust is for suckers. Conventions and faith is for the religious (they will be rewarded for that behaviour elsewhere, so they are insured). Old Days thinking makes us more susceptible to poor advice. Don't be fooled, these so-called experts who nobly expound their advice are human and as capable of failure and subjective assumptions as you or I. Peak behind the curtain and it can often be no more than smoke and mirrors.

_Implicit (mindless) trust in Expert Opinion gets us all in trouble._

The recent financial crisis was built upon mindless trust. The likes of [Standard & Poor, Moody's and Fitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_%28credit_rating_agencies%29) gave _Expert Advice_ on [CDOs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) - high risk (as it was found) financial instruments that underpinned the US property bubble that was at the centre of the crisis in 2007. A bit of Googling to crowd source advice on the safety of investment in these would have likely saved a lot of people a lot of money.
