**Or, why Conservative America should fight for an Open Internet and privacy protection.**

A lot of people seem oblivious to the assault on two fronts to their privacy. On the one hand, the government is allowed access, often through local laws (and back doors), to their personal information, backed by outlandish claims of protecting the citizen and their _children_. On the other, companies use the personal information given to them for purposes often outside of the terms the information was given, generally to sell them more stuff.

But why should we care as a whole?  The current erosion of privacy is a means to an end. That end is to prolong the status quo of centralised government and Old Days corporate values.

As long as mankind has lived in large social groups information has been power and the control of information _is_ the embodiment of power. This power historically resided outside the individual and in "leaders" in various (sinister) forms. The Internet disrupted this. It brought a means to access more information for more people and _currently_ with low rates of **intervention**. Complete control has been temporarily loosened; power in the hegemonic entities that once controlled us has been diminished by the power of the Internet; we are making more independent (and bad) decisions than ever before.

The Internet allowed (briefly) a de facto _Libertarian_ society. And we didn't have to take ourselves into the woods to enjoy it.

So it is ironic (hugely so) that the very advocates of Internet control and personal limitations (representatives from Conservative America) so vehemently _**claim**_ Libertarian goals while their **_acts_** support centralisation and state control.

Centralisation and (naive) interventionist policy has an extremely poor track record of looking after the individual. From feudal kingdoms, to Soviet Russia to 1950s America, the central state has proven wholly unsuited to deliver anything long lived with regard to intrinsic ethical value to individuals (though it thinks it does). It can only function in generalisations. A parody to suit only the model citizen. Corporations are no better, if not worse if you dig below the headline death tolls. The most cost effect way to sell is to be big enough to influence whole economies, then generalise. Like central government, it can only work if the consumer is idealised.

So, why do we care? Listen, I don't care because I am particularly private person (says as types blog). Rather I care because I am surrendering control over my life. I am allowing others to make judgements and decisions about me without my say so, or even participation. In short I am allowing others to make decisions on my behalf, be it what I buy, or how I live my life. The erosion of my privacy is an erosion of my quality of life. _And I don't want to go back to the Old Days, before the Internet._

I like buying things online. I like the way that you can research and compare the experiences of others that have purchased the products I may buy. However, as my privacy is eroded, my autonomy over my ability to seek my ideal product is constrained. The Internet is being hijacked to "make it easier for me", to "filter out the noise so I can make a better choice." A BETTER CHOICE! I DON'T WANT A BETTER CHOICE! I want to be able to make (bad) decisions on what I buy myself, without corporate interference. _That's why I buy online._

The Internet is allowing us choice and quality (and bad purchase decisions) beyond our wildest dreams. But it doesn't fit the Old Days centralist agenda. The old paradigms were being torn up and the new world it brings the unknown. The unknown is frightening to the centralist as the centralist takes so long to change. The Internet (currently) also protects my right to present my beliefs and views the way I want to. I can be myself. But to be myself I often need _anonymity_.

I don't want to swap all that (with all its occasional warts and boils and crappy devices) for the Old Days of being told who I am, what I should buy, what I should be.

The lines are being drawn.
