I admire the thoughts and concerns of those who predict mankind's imminent doom. They scare us and inject urgency into our thinking. I believe (and unknown to them) they are the main agents of our progress. Without them we would have most likely died out as a species due to complacency or just plain laziness.

These people are not the Millenarian crazies, those that believe that some messiah will call time on our world to bring a worldly paradise, or similar ideological nonsense. No, these people doggedly (and ambitiously) point out the potential fragility of the world we live in and how we may be bringing our own doom.

Man's ingenuity in adversity is evident everywhere. It comes from thinking born in the harsh light of our dawn on the plains of Africa where a single misstep would mean a meal for another species, or a similar violent end. As our ingenuity made the struggle for life a simpler battle to win, our minds have created ever more complex drivers for ingenuity - a type of thinking that states our world is going to end and asks what are we going to do to avert it.

The End of the World has been predicted (as a constant) throughout our history. Mankind's civilisation has emerged and developed until it has covered the globe and as it has advanced the possible means of its destruction has multiplied in our minds: one feeds the other.

Now let me be plain, I am not saying that there is no threat. Our world may come to an end at any time due to our inaction or action. Climate change, inept banking practices, misuse of antibiotics, careless tinkering with viruses, meteor strikes, alien invasions, other unknown lurking threats, could all end the world as we know it. But it is those who bang the drum for doomsday scenarios ensures we hold our innate fear of cataclysm as real (enough) to drive us to mitigate the risk.

_Whether or not the risks of doom are real, they drive us on to be ingenious, have ideas and innovate._

For example, a significant rationale for doom-filled thinking is that the modern world is no more than a mirage, an intangible thing that is inevitably going to crash to the ground and throw us (the survivors) back to a primitive life. "We are all living on borrowed time!", they cry. This thinking leeches into so many aspects of our world, flowing into our subconscious, it has become an undercurrent that drags us to improve our position (real or otherwise).

My point here is that it doesn't matter whether the threat is real or not; the outcome is beneficial.

To understand this thinking we need to accept its key dimension: the assumption (by the doomsters and ourselves) that something built upon a tangible thing is better (safer) than that built upon the intangible. How can we test that? Is it really true, particularly in our hugely complex world?

What is tangible?

How many times from the tangible do we have to go before the abstracted tangible is in fact intangible?

We chose to make our world an abstract thing two millennia ago (or more) when Classical thought put us apart from the real world. Tangible threat is being pulled from our sleep to be eaten by hyenas or lions or wolves, being helpless in the face of the Natural world. As this threat was diminished (by removing it from the world) the tangible became less obvious, less connected to the everyday life of man. The resultant world we lived in was increasingly unrelated to that of Nature. We were not a helpless part of a bigger system, a link in the food chain; we were in control. God(s) gave us the right to be so. And to ensure our position we needed to explain our place at its head. To make sense of it all. To ensure we commanded a means to control it.

We explain the world through theory and fact, a retrospective activity to increase our confidence in the face of Nature. And why bother explaining (theorising) how things work? Why work out how many angels you could dance upon the head of a pin?

To continue to survive. We need to make sense of it all to confirm and continue our mastery over it. To do so we must explain our world in more and more complex ways. Yet, and here's the rub, always in our stomachs is that aching doubt we are wrong, _that we are incomplete in our understanding_.

It is this that, that doubt, that drives our considerable imaginations to make our world easier and safer to dwell in.

And as our world falls further from the tangible (and becomes more abstract) we need to ensure we retain the immediacy of threat, any threat, to drive us on. We look back (theorise) and look forward (practically innovate) in order to meet the threat that surrounds us.

To be at our best (as a species), we _need_ to stare into the abyss. We need to teeter on the edge of the precipice of our doom. Only at the brink are we truly innovative, driven to create bridges that will take us to safer ground.

To be at our best (as individuals) we _need_ to feel the breath of the lion upon our sleeping faces. We need to feel our place in the world is exposed and uncertain. Only then do we feel truly alive, driven to help create a safer world beyond the dark beneath.

I will return to this as a theme as it is the key driver to ideas and to innovation.
