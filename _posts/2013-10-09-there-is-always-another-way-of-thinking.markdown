## Sometimes we need to be jolted out of the rut of our thinking


I guess, at heart, I am a socialist. So when I originally saw the [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com) Op/Ed, "[Give Back? Yes, It's Time For The 99% To Give Back To The 1%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/harrybinswanger/2013/09/17/give-back-yes-its-time-for-the-99-to-give-back-to-the-1/)", I kind of shrugged and thought it was just another cheap-shot dig at the poor by some right-wing elitist loony.

I actually passed over it, really just glancing at the article. I don't know much about the author, [Harry Binswanger](http://www.hblist.com/bio.htm); I'm only very roughly familiar with [Ayn Rand](http://www.aynrand.org/) who Binswanger derives much of his own philosophy. At the time I felt there was nothing in the article, or Binswanger (or Ayn Rand) that made me want to hang around. Hell, I didn't even read the comments at the end and usually they are the most entertaining part of any polemic.

_But, something in the proposition got me thinking._

It kept popping back into my mind. The concept is just too bold, too crazy; maybe Binswanger was actually satirizing the One Percent's grip upon our society and presenting [a modest proposal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal) to highlight the ludicrous nature of the super wealthy.

_So I re-read it and the ludicrous comments that followed._

The comments were much as I expected, full of outrage, angst or even pity; support was from the general membership I had originally labelled Binswanger of holding.

The article, briefer than I recalled, proposed a simpler argument: this was not some [Swiftian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift) satire. Or at least not one I could tell: Binswanger was playing this straight.

_So is he right? Should we, the 99%, give unfettered adulation, wealth and honour to the One Percent?_

Maybe. Actually I don't care _that_ much. I still am not _that_ interested in Binswanger (or Ayn Rand).

That's not the point to me. What the article did achieve is to jolt me from a rut of thinking, where nice, neat, black and white issues of right and wrong were unchallenged in my mind; that the fact that the vast majority of wealth is held by the smallest minority is morally wrong; that minority are at emotional logger-heads with the moral majority (who happen not to hold the wealth).

Binswanger reminded me that an Old Days status quo can often be thrown over whichever societal problem is in question.

Once we lived in much more violent times than we do so (generally) today. Society's response was to dish out violence (justice) to the perpetrators; hang them; burn them; crucify them. Today only in those still violent places of the world is capital punishment provided as justice to violence.

It is a curious fact that we feel morally justified to punish violent members of society with more violence: an eye for an eye just feels right. But the most peaceful places in the world call that out to be a lie - a nasty trick of our natural emotions. Those places, those countries, have long banned capital punishment and outlawed parents from physically punishing their children. The truth is that violent deterrents do little or nothing to deter violence. Fact. States with violent judicial systems are invariably more violent societally.

So, as with the counterintuitive nature of violence, maybe wealth is also a victim of our ill-placed collective emotions.

Maybe encouraging (outrageous) spending amongst the wealthy is a better means of redistribution than forcing them to do so through punitive taxation.
