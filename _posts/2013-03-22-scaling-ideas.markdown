I recently wrote a post that tried to tackle the complex topic of ideas. I gave it a go.

I'd like to have another go. After all, my view is that ideas are throwaway, ephemeral, even the treatment of them. We use them and then we discard them unless they are instilled with virtue, then they are made dogma and then we are in trouble.

The point of the previous post was to show that there are no bad ideas, only ideas; unless you attach emotion to them. Then they stick - like the proverbial to a blanket.

How do we make our ideas better without devaluing them with sentiment?

Say you have 5 ideas. Good ideas. This is a good place to be.



	
  * Idea number 1 you cull straight away; it does not pass your internal "Idea QA process"; the others pass;

	
  * Idea number 2 your first reviewer cuts after your initial description; the others pass.

	
  * Idea number 3 your second review cuts after your initial description; the others pass.

	
  * Idea number 4 ideas you take forward and invest 3 months telling other people about, then cull due to lack of wider interest; the last idea passes;

	
  * Idea number 5 is then taken on for a further 6 months with multiple presentations and reworks of material describing the virtues of the idea and how it will change everything.


Then, another idea (number 6) comes to you while flogging idea 5 about town. It takes number 5 and flips it over into a different proposition entirely. You go to a bar and kick it about with a couple of friends. They are amazed! The idea simply changes everything! They practically drag you to other people to tell your idea. This is the one.

Ah, but here's the rub: Idea 5 has slowly, ever so slowly gained acceptance; you have bludgeoned people into seeing its virtue. You have worked it into people's thinking. You have extracted money and reputation on the basis of the idea. You have made the idea you own, you are bound to it.

_What to do?_

It looks like, ideally, you go with both. It's that simple. Idea 6, as a rock start concept, should grow in acceptance at a faster rate than number 5. It should take less effort, it should have greater reward. Meanwhile idea 5 ticks over, bringing in the reward of the investment already made.

There is a greater level of investment in number 5, both financial and reputational. You have sold this sucker and there are sunk costs to recoup. If you ditch it now you will lose face and money.

But you can't, you can't tend to the needs of both ideas; you can't maintain ownership of both. There is insufficient capacity in your system. If you do go with both, both will suffer and you most likely will deliver neither, losing more face and more money.

_The catch_

It looks like you have options. You had one option, a great idea; now you have two options, two great ideas. But actually you have pseudo-optionality. This has caused a net increase in risk: you still have all you eggs in one basket. You only differ from your starting proposition by having two eggs instead of one.

_So, what to do?_

You are the basket. You are the capacity problem; you are the single point of failure.

To progress you need to solve this, you need to ensure that only the ideas are the point of failure, not you. How can you do this?

_Collaborate_

Only by collaborating can you solve the problem. Individual genius is one of the greatest myths of mankind. Historical moments of genius delivery of ideas are just that, history. It is merely the narrative of the victor. The narrative being only another part of a collaborative invention.

By collaboration you not only remove the single basket, you also allow another means of idea collation: your collaborators will provide both a channel for your ideas and a source of new ideas for you as a channel.

The fact is that idea 5 (in our story) was not really yours. There were a number of tinkerings that led to the idea being augmented and improved through the ongoing interaction with others. This is inevitable. This is the very essence of innovation that makes simple ideas into great ideas. You cannot be precious with your ideas and achieve this. You cannot dwell on the emotion of your creativity.

_Only collaboration gives this. Only working with others works to take and make them into something better. Only this, not you alone.
