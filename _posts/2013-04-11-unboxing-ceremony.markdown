_Bright lights, dancing girls, grand pronouncements of revolutionary change. Our product will change the way you do what you do today!_

When a significant new product comes to market nowadays it is afforded a similar fanfare to that of a Hollywood blockbuster. Eager consumers await (queue all night) with bated breath the ceremony of "Unboxing" to see if the rumours are true that this is a revolutionary launch, something that will improve our world - a "step change".

Most often we feel let down. The fanfare is generally in reverse proportion to the _revolutionary_ nature of the product at hand. We are given in most cases an "incremental" improvement, not the hoped for "step change".

Marketing pizazz aside, the overwhelming majority of ideas feel like this - incremental. And we are disappointed.

Should we be? No.

_Significant change in the world is rare indeed. A freakish event. We are ruled by the laws of Nature that dictates slow, incremental changes over a long period of time. This has brought the vast variety of life we see around us. Diversity and sensational form and function is the product of endless chance tinkerings over mind-boggling timeframes. _

In fact the anticipated "step change" we so hope for is sleight of hand; it is a trick. The step change never really happens. Not really. It is all part of the show; they draw our eyes away from the product's predecessors and we then are invited to see it as something entirely new, radical. Often we are tricked into seeing something that is entirely new - a first - when in fact it is only the first to be done well.

_Think about the examples of that: the bigger the "step change" proposed, the bigger the set of antecedents that got it there._

This is good. This is the natural way of things. The goal should be the iterative; the first to do something really well, not to be just the first. Not to be "new" and bring a "step change", but to bring something of high quality and utility into the world. Look about and see other things done badly and change them to be done well. Quality, not "newness" should be our measure.

_That is innovation_. Not the show, not the fanfare.

Enjoy the dancing, the lights, the sensational claims. But judge the quality, judge the execution of the product - and, oh, don't be so disappointed.

_It is all getting us to where we want to go, just more slowly that you had imagined or hoped._

Oh, and of course, if we accept that iteration and incremental improvement - doing things well, not doing things first - is the key to true innovation, what does that say of the hamfisted way we protect innovation? What does it say about intellectual property?

_A topic for another day..._
