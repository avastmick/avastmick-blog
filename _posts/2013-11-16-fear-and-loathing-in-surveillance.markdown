#### _We are all being watched. All the time._


_Feel comfortable with that?_

This is an emotional topic (a bit like [GM foods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food)). It is mainly about our _feelings_. Sifting through the rights and wrongs of the issue has become too difficult, so we typically drift between fear and loathing, through frequent periods of profound apathy. But I think there is another way of looking at the issue, one that may actually solve some significant problems.

Now the dust has settled and regardless of the rights and wrongs of his actions, what _is_ true of [Edward Snowden](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/edward-snowden) is that he has made us think about the on-going, ubiquitous covert collection of our digital data. He has made it front-page news.

There are two distinct sides to the Snowden-NSA discussion. But, these sides are not what you may think. Whether it is for some greater good to snoop on us all, or whether it is wholly bad is all moot - an entirely worthless debate. That horse has long gone; if you interact digitally your data is sucked up, tracing your every move, your every click. As ex-NSA chief [Bobby Ray Inman ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Ray_Inman)said, does it really matter whether your information is gathered by Google and Facebook, or by the [NSA](http://www.nsa.gov) and [GCHQ](http://www.gchq.gov.uk)? Why should the corporate world be treated differently to any other.

_No, the two sides of this argument are whether the collection is transparent and open, or secret and unregulated. Whether the data collected is available to all, or only available to those who want to control it and its subjects. __ _

What are the upsides to mass data collection? No one is asking this question.

Can the NSA show a truly positive usage of the data they collect. Can they, say, show data usage and cost saving for Health policy reform?

The way the discussion is being conducted at the moment is by two sides that add no obvious value to society. The NSA that instils fear and uses it as a means to argue for its intrusion. Or, the libertarian or liberal instils loathing of this invasion of our privacy. What neither articulates clearly are the risks and benefits, for and against. Being both _Old Days _entities this is typical. Move the argument to the emotional end of the spectrum and remove any rational or logical discussion. Make it all worthless.

The NSA's stock response to criticism (identically used by the likes of GCHQ in the UK, or [GCSB](http://gcsb.govt.nz/) in New Zealand) is to claim their surveillance is protecting us from harm. "_This is all in your best interests, people,_" they say. What they don't do is list precisely the harms they are protecting us from - those, of course, are secret.

Any right-minded individual would argue that a repeat of 9/11 would be awful and avoiding such a repeat is worth a significant cost to society. But while the sentiment feels sound, the execution of it is manifestly not. The NSA and their ilk have a mind-bogglingly sophisticated surveillance, built at astounding cost, but it has done nothing to prevent similar attacks in London, Madrid and Boston, let alone countless (adjudged) less mediaworthy locations around the globe. In short, the NSA cannot justify their benefit to us by disclosing their successes. In fact, frequently the lapses in intelligence gathering and investigation that allowed these attacks have been shown to be laughably inept. (Cue jokes about the intelligence of these Intelligence agencies).

_They cannot clearly describe the benefits to our society that the stunning financial cost, the loss of individual freedom and huge personal inconvienience should have brought._

Likewise, the libertarian or liberal response is similarly empty of benefit. Beyond the myth of the Private Individual, what societal progress is gained by reversing what the NSA (or Google and Facebook) has done? Will we be happier, more free? They cannot tell us in terms that are not purely emotional. They cannot clearly articulate the benefit of all this privacy. They cannot describe the intrinsic value to society of your business being your business alone.

So can we actually discuss the topic sensibly? I think so. I think there is something else at play here, something actually tangible. I am coming to appreciate this challenge to the traditional ideas of [personal privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) and (by extension) secrecy being sacrosanct. Instead, let's get it all out in the open.


#### _What have you all got to hide?_


Like most people, I've nothing of particular interest to hide. I've never belonged to a political party of any kind let alone any with radical tendencies. Nor do I express, or have ever expressed, support of violent means to solve mankind's problems. The evidence I see shows the opposite: violent societies are typically violent in their judiciary; the violent overthrow of a despot invariably leads to another (violent) despot.

So, if all my digital interaction are there for all to see, would I be a social outcast? I doubt it. Maybe I'd lose the respect of a few people for being overly gossipy or polically incorrect. Maybe I would offend a few. I am just not interesting enough to be incriminated by my personal information; nor would I be particularly affected socially by what I've said in digital form.

So I am not particularly bothered by the NSA or alike snooping on what I say. Maybe this blog entry may hit a few key-word alerts in the system, but I not too concerned. I trust they have bigger problems on their hands right now than little, prattling, me.

And if the NSA were to really dislike what I say, or some ego-maniac politician in the New Zealand government fails to fathom the function of my chatter, they can frankly _fuck off_. I don't watch what I say _because _I have nothing to hide. I don't have fear of repercussions because I have faith in the society we have built collectively, where I feel confident _because_ I am sharing openly for all to see.

That all said, there is some residual worry. Those clowns who state they operate in our best interests (both sides in this case) have a truly shocking record throughout history of actually fulfilling their promise. More frequently than is comfortable, the omnipotent protector bcomes the oppressor.

The German movie [_The Lives of Others_ ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) beautifully illustrates the potential human cost of this empty promise and of NSA-style surveillance if allowed to continue in it's current _secret_ form. The fear will quickly move from one threat to another, from terrorist attack to fear of authoritarian retribution.

_(So, if I go missing you all know why!)_


#### The Other Option


Throughout all the revelations contained in the data releases throughout 2013 at no point has the NSA clearly articulated any actual damage done. They have claimed they have, but like their reasoning for their collection in the first place it is purely emotional rhetoric, not facts. They claim lives have been put in danger, but seem unable to provide reasoned and detailed proof of any actual damage done. All that has happened is that they have been embarrassed by the revelations, shamed by their overreach.

This is kernal of my argument. We live in fear of truth being told but when it is told, the effect is generally no more than some (or considerable) embarrassment. Like me, if my information was fully in the public domain; I'd be embarrassed by that flippant SMS, or inappropriate email; some people _may_ be angry with me, but no one will have died.

There is no doubt that the NSA are embarrassed by and furious at Edward Snowden, but what damage has actually been done? They being held to account? They are increasingly being put under pressure to become more transparent in their actions. There are demands they be less secret in their operation. All this can only be a good thing, only the ego-maniac, the sociopath, thinks themself above scrutiny and account - we can all improve the way we behave.

Edward Snowden has shown (unintentionally) that transparency could be the way forward, where openness is the answer to not only the issue at hand but wider societal behaviour. So, instead of this information being secretly held in the hands of huge corporations or clandestine government organisations, everyone would have easier access to everyone else's information. We would then be all held to account for our actions, all held under scrutiny.

I think it can be argued that the upsides of this are greater than the downsides.

Some people will come off badly and suffer miserably. Politicians would obviously not come out well; nor would those who preside over the likes of the NSA; marketing and sales functions in the corporate world would be significantly hit. Basically, any line of work or lifestyle that relies on lies or half-truths to gain the upper hand. Bigots would have little recourse but to keep their nasty thoughts in their heads.

_The world would become a better place._

Okay, this is pie in the sky. Pigs would surely fly before the NSA shared their secrets. Unicorns would emerge from enchanted forests across the globe before bigots, spies and politicians were endangered species.

Sure. But I do think the _Old Days_ are numbered; people are changing how they think about their lives, what they share and how they share it. Maybe this openness will just become the norm. In the near future we will all share so much data about ourselves we will be largely in the public domain without the need for sophisticated mass surveillance. Tools to access the data would be publically available. Those without a viable digital social footprint would become untrusted - _what do they have to hide_?

Our future leaders - teenagers - just don't care that their information is hosed all over the Internet in the open. In fact the decline in the active youth segment on Facebook has been widely attributed to the higher levels of complexity brought by privacy controls and alike.

They just don't understand what the fuss is all about. They, it seems, have little to hide. Perhaps their world will be more open, less secretive.
