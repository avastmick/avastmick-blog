Gold, the metal element (Au), has had value to mankind for as long as we know. Cultural consensus bestowed upon it properties that do not align with the physical.

_Why?_

It is pretty; it is easily shaped into intricate shapes; it doesn't tarnish or corrode; it is heavy in the hand, it is substantial.

_But_

It is not especially rare; it it not strong; it easily wears away; it cannot be eaten.

_Value outside usefulness_

Scared, tired and hungry, early man would have squat in the dirt and handled this pretty, soft and heavy metal. He couldn't eat it; it did not sustain him; it couldn't be fashioned into any useful tool; but somehow it was valuable to him.

And it was not just him, other humans would have seen something made from the yellow metal and desired it - like a magpie wanting shiny objects for its nest. At that moment, that very special moment, a remarkable thing happened. 

_Money was born._

One human would own something of tangible value like flint arrow heads, a warm animal skin, an obsidian axe: things that would help keep you alive. They would willingly give these things in exchange for something basically worthless - objects that could not directly assist the chances of survival such as gold, jade, brittle gems, pretty sea shells, even carved wooden or bone curios. These all gained tangible value when exchanged for the tools of survival or comfort.

_The basis of civilisation_

The simple exchange of something with obvious and direct value for something of no obvious value is the basis of our civilisation. Trading food, water, shelter, clothing, tools or alike for gold or sea shells - the tangible for the intangible - has exploded into a vast array of complex exchanges, built up layer upon layer over thousands of years.

The simple exchange of magpie-liked shiny objects for things that allow you to simply survive has been built upon in a wondrous system of unimagined complexity where the boundaries of tangible and intangible are lost through the useful becoming useless, the useless becoming intrinsically useful.

Think today, would you trade a polished gold nugget for a set of flint arrows? But you may trade the alignment of electrons in a complex machine you do not own or operate for gold nuggets and flint arrows. You would not think twice about the means of exchange, even though it is as far from a real thing as you can go - it is only the promise of payment, the thing in your hand (your nugget) has no physical counterpart in the transaction.

Why our brains work like this I don't know. What I do know is that it is fantastic that it does.

If we keep in our minds as we live our lives that very first monetary exchange, everything is simplified. At every turn there is transaction: an exchange or a trade. We trade time, exchange information and swap objects for purely the promise of payment. However complex these transactions are they are no more in essence than the ancient act of grubbing up gold from the dirt and swapping it for a stone tool to dig for more.
