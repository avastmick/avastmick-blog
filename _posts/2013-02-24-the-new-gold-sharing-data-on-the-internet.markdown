[![Gold](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130311-174904.jpg)](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130311-174904.jpg)_Data is the new gold._

Let me be more specific, data of a certain currency, personal information - data that tells others about ourselves.

The commercial value of knowing who someone is, what their interests are, what they want to buy and, most critically, whether they can afford it, is enormous. It is the gold that bankrolls Google and Facebook. They grasp this gold at our every touch of the Internet. Their vaults groan with it. They issue the paper equivalent to other companies based on it - advertising. They tax us by the covert collection of it.

The Internet is beautiful. A chaotic, organic thing that feeds on our data and grows into enticing shapes and behaviour. It is uncontrolled and unpredictable. This is its beauty.

But control the data and the beauty dies. Rather than wildly ranging in amazing, unimagined directions, it will be harnessed to a corporate cart, directed by a business suited driver leading it to market. The [wild mustang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang_horse) has become a plodding cart horse.

We are allowing this. We are allowing Old Days institutions, particularly organisations, to tie up our data. Every time we idlely click consent to obtuse and opaque terms and conditions we are fitting the bit into the mouth of the Internet. Think carefully about what you share about yourself and how easy you make it to obtain.
