Our data is spread across many places. From the sports club where you have a membership, to the various government agencies that hold data about you to Internet social media, to banks, to... well, you get the point - it's everywhere. Wherever you have an interaction, pay a bill, submit a return, you leave the mark of you by leaving your data. This is what makes you, you. 

This is your identity, your Personal Information. _And people want it!_

In the [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) this was all pretty containable, simpler to maintain. One organisation couldn't simply share the data they had about you with another. It was either ephemeral (forgotten) or it was paper (filed), held literally in data warehouses. I mean literally. Inefficient warehouses of paper data in archives across the land. Almost impossible to retrieve data from in a useable way.

Then came the Internet. Sharing was but a click away and our Personal Information, the very thing that makes us, us in society is sprayed about, stored, retrieved, sold and re-shared and sprayed some more. _Now people really want it!_

Our information is now digital and eminently portable. Rather than boxes of files left carelessly on a taxi (historically done, but hard to do I'd imagine), our details can be leaked out in a simple, careless email (recently done and done more often than hits the headlines).

How can we bring back some comfort to our privacy? I certainly don't want to go back to a kind of Digital Old Days. But do want to move to somewhere where our data is not sprayed about in such an uncontrolled way. How? _By not sharing the data at all.
_
Why do organisations feel they need to have actual data about us? Or why do they feel they need to share or provide data about us. _On the whole they don't_. 

Does your bank need proof of your income? To actually know how much you earn? No. It doesn't. All it _actually_ needs to know is you earn enough to fulfil the credit services they may offer you. _What they actually need to know is, "Yes he does." , not "$75,000"._

Why does the government feel it can create "data sharing agreements" and look-up at our data without our participation, or explicit knowledge. Who would specifically vote for that? So I can more efficiently pay my taxes? _Come on!_ 

They should be looking instead at the business outcome needed, not the data. Like the banks they currently use raw data to reach a business decision and then, for an unclear reason, retain that data; data that will quickly become stale too. No, what they need is the outcome of, say, a means test, not the data as an input in to it.

No, our personal information should stay where it is. We can share our own content and clog the Internet that way, but leave our personal information where it is.
