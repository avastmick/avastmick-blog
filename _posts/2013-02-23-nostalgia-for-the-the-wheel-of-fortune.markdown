[![20130306-185031.jpg](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130306-185031.jpg)](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130306-185031.jpg)I love the show Mad Men. My favourite scene is from the Season one episode "The Wheel", where the main protagonist, Don Draper, utterly nails an advertising pitch to a potential client, Kodak. Don uses an old back story about when he was just starting on his road to be an advertising god, setting himself up with the credentials of his old mentor, Teddy.

The scene is interesting for a number of reasons, beyond the performance itself (which is stellar):



	
  * _One_, the customer is Kodak, the epitome of the an Old Days corporation, one that clung to a originally lucrative, but overtly non-volatile business model until it killed it;

	
  * _Two_, that Don's pitch was themed on a novel take on "nostalgia". Don says, 'Nostalgia - it's delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek "nostalgia" literally means, "the pain from an old wound."'

	
  * _Three_, Don is pitching to sell a product of real innovation, Kodak's Carousel, an idea so simple, yet so useful, it was literally a killer app of its day.


In the Old Days innovation was there, but it was controlled, kept behind the scenes until it had the correct means of control of consumption applied. Often, as here, the Old Days would play innovation through the lens of even Older Days using the "potent" force of nostalgia to sell to us dreams.

These Older Days dreams were where we lived ideal lives and were model, ideal citizens. So really they were nightmares where we were excluded from the innovation and were just mindless consumers.

Kodak had a large R&D department where they invented things like the Carousel. In these labs they invented the very thing that killed them: digital photography. They didn't commercialise their discovery for two reasons:

	
  * _One_, the margin was low compared to the huge margins of their existing controlled (70% of the) market offering;

	
  * _Two_, they could not fit it into their existing Older Days world view. They literally didn't know what to do with their child. And because in the Old Days information was so controlled no one could work it out for them. So they locked their child away. They hoped it would be forgotten.


_In the Old Days innovation happened in spite of everything. Like life clinging on in an inhospitable place. Nostalgia was just a device to sell you, not innovation, but a controlling dream of Older Days._

Then came the Internet. Innovation came out from the cellar and wreaking revenge on its spiteful parents. The Internet freed innovation from stifling control and allowed us to collaborate on what can be done with it. We're in a better place.

_ I have no sentimental value attached to the Old Days, to me it is literally a pain from an old wound._
