_How many times at the end of a project have you (honestly) looked back and thought, "I wouldn't have predicted that outcome when I started out!" If you did, most likely the outcome was good, better than how you originally thought it would be. I have done this more often than not. The reason for this phenomenon is that the ideas that brought about the successful delivery of the project were antifragile._

If you don't know about [Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/)'s concept of [_antifragile_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder), you should. Not to over play this, but _antifragile_ may well be a monumental milestone in western philosophy; it could literally change the way we look at the world.

The concept is delicate however, like its antecedent _Evolution_, it doesn't take well to short-termist verbal exposition. It needs time and practical examples to show its strength; it needs variety to thrive in concept.

So, let's think about ideas in context to antifragility. Some of the (measurable) characteristics of antifragility are precisely the characteristics of successful ideas. The ingredients of randomness, volatility and unpredictability all enhance the flavour of the successful idea.

_Every successful idea that brings practical benefit has to be antifragile. _

Let's test this hypothesis conceptually. What is the recipe for a successful idea? Roughly, (and I mean roughly), take a problem, throw a number a potential solutions at it, iterate over these, demand feedback; cull those solutions that do not meet requirement; tinker further, then repeat. Any winner from this process has survived all manner of difficulty; if the process is rigorous enough (more of that in a bit) the outcome should be a robust idea capable of survival in execution.

A successful idea is not fragile, it grows and gains from each bump and bang along its being brought into the world. The more volatile the journey to its delivery the more improved its character. The more unpredictable the outcome the more the idea is innovative. Ideas grow from the process like an organism (or generations of organisms) mutating to thrive in any given environment.

_Throw away ideas with abandon, they are easy to come by._

If you are precious in your ideas and do not bounce them about, testing them, trying to kill them at every turn, they will be weak. The outcome will be a puny runt incapable of survival. Your process of generating viable ideas must be rigorous, hard, _tough_; it needs to stress each idea, each candidate solution to the problem; it must mercilessly cull any idea that does not stand up to scrutiny or that cannot be clearly executed to meet the problem.

_Avoid prediction as your guide, it isn't a map to your goal.
_

If you are trying to be innovative, don't attempt to predict the outcome. Let the ideas come to you (give them time to do so), let others bring them, let accidents happen and react agilely. Prediction is too tricky (and tricksy) to rely on. The outcome to the predicted is generally make-do or an ill fit to need. Do not predict, allow yourself to be able cope with whatever (ideas) comes your way.

And to improve even further? You must make yourself antifragile. You must ensure that you are equal to your ideas. First you must expose yourself to failure. A good quote:


<blockquote>[To start a project: to make yourself so at home with total failure you stand a chance of being calm enough to succeed.](https://twitter.com/alaindebotton/status/316434595883151360)</blockquote>


As your ideas benefit from the compound benefits of the failure of other ideas, so do you benefit through failure. The more you have failed, the more you have worked with others' failure, the more likely you are to identify success and by extension achieve it.
