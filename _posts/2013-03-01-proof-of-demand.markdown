I used to work in the media industry in the UK. At the time we called it "New Media". We were funky and cool, we had ridden out the Dotcom bust and the new millennium. We were going to do something great. We were going to deliver content to people in new (fantastic) ways. Above all we really wanted to provide this content when and where a person wanted it.

_We wanted to challenge the status quo._

In a workshop to determine the viability of Video on Demand on Cable, I was told (emphatically) there was no evidence there was consumer demand for the service. They (the marketing and advertising people) had done extensive consumer testing and market research, no one was interested.

_They were saying there was no known demand for a service that did not exist._

My story was set in the early days of the millennium. The result in 2004 was the first "pure" VOD service in the world (Comcast claim that, but they were using smoke and mirrors trust me).

Today one of the largest users of Internet bandwidth is [Netflix](http://netflix.com). People wanted Video on Demand after-all. They just did not know it when the market researcher asked the question in 2001.

This curious viewpoint behaviour is commonplace. I see it as Old Days thinking.

Steve Jobs argued the opposite view. To paraphrase, he stated that he didn't rely on consumer testing (focus groups and alike). He was confident enough in his innovation that when people saw what he had produced they would buy it.

Apple has had a good track record of success in pitching innovation at the market and it being a runaway success. But even Apple can get stuck in Old Days thinking, caught up in their own prediction.

Steve Jobs also stated that there was no proof of demand for a phone larger than 3.75" (or thereabouts). Consumer testing (yes, that's right), had "proven" than the optimal size for mobile phone usage was the size of the iPhone (then version 4). The testing had (irrefutably) showed that size was the happy medium that allowed people to use their device one-handed as they had done with non-touch devices previously.

So when Samsung released the Galaxy Note people laughed. Its screen was 5" and it looked huge! It was huge. Reviewers ridiculed the "experiment", stating how relived they were to go back to their Jobsean Mean-sized phone, noting how well it slid into their pocket compared with Samsung's practically tablet-sized beast.

I too struggled to see the attraction of the phone. When I first saw a guy at work take a call with one it reminded me immediately of Dom Jolly's ["The Big Phone Guy"](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=27aVPqpnL7Y&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D27aVPqpnL7Y&gl=GB). It looked so odd, _so different from the then norms of mobile phone use._

Jobs was wrong. Well, before the whole Internet rises up to defend their hero, Jobs got the topic wrong, he was wrong about the wrong thing. Actually, people didn't want a mobile phone at all, they wanted a _mobile computing device._

The best selling "smart phone" of 2013 was the Samsung Galaxy S3", a 4.7" device. Near the top of the list was the Samsung's Galaxy Note 2, a whopping 5.5". Interestingly the iPhone 5 is 4", also bigger than the Jobsean Mean-sized phone.

Okay, all this is well known, well documented; personally, I own a 4.5" "phone". The fact is consumers don't really like big phones, rather they like large mobile computing devices they _occasionally_ make phone calls with. This is the point Jobs missed - _and could not practically predict:_

_People didn't want a mobile phone. They wanted something else_

With mobile data cheapening and more (reliably) available, people moved on from the original iPhone usage where it was primarily a phone with useful content consumption add-ons, to mobile devices that are primarily a mobile content consumption device with a useful phone add-on.

Steve Jobs could not have predicted this shift. Not reasonably. Not even Steve.

In the same way as Kodak Eastman could not have reasonably predicted the death of their business by means of their own invention, digital photography.

However, Apple will not die due to the result of their invention (touch-screen mobile phones). (Though they may for other reasons.) They will adapt. They are not Kodak Eastman, an Old Days company; they are the epitome of Internet business.

Why is this?

_In simple (or simplistic) terms, the difference is cost._

The cost for Kodak Eastman to test the market with digital photography would have been enormous. They would have gambled on unknown demand. to do so they would have to have created a complete industry vertical to support their innovative offspring: the image capture devices (cameras) would have been expensive and novel to create, meaning bespoke factories and logistics lines; means for consumers to view, select and print would need to be rolled out across the planet, another bespoke manufacturing initiative. Risk grows enormously.

When Apple launched the iPod, like Kodak Eastman, they too needed to create a market vertical for it. The device, the content market-place, the payments, the means of access, they all needed to be stood up for the ease of consumer consumption. They designed the whole experience. However, the world was different, it was online, on the Internet. Apple could leverage a whole selection of technologies at a reasonable cost to launch. Their marketplace was in the cloud (before the Cloud); people purchased virtually from an online store. They used their own home computer to upload their music to their iPod.Â Apple could lean on earlier innovation; they had the Walkman, had other digital music devices, to compare with and refine into an overall market strategy.

Things were a little unfair on Kodak Eastman (generally). Consumers didn't own their own computers. Their innovation had no antecedents. Kodak did not really have anything to lean on. They were groping in the dark. Full of fear at the unpredictable outcome. Seeing a future balance sheet with a big red column.

It was the Old Days, things were just harder then, really hard. Being innovative was an elite activity, hugely expensive, risky and difficult to manage. They would fall back on _market research_ and similar pointless prediction to guide their decisions. Get it wrong and the result would be catastrophic.

_Today It is just easier to be innovative; to test the market with crazy ideas._

When Samsung wanted to test the market the consumer response to a big-ass mobile phone they didn't use focus groups or and market research, they made the device and put it out there. They can prototype with 3D printers; manufacture with commodity components; market online; distribute centrally; fulfil locally.

When Netflix wanted to do a Video on Demand service their job was easier and cheaper than it was for the Cable companies who tried it before them. They could test out their ideas relatively unconstrained (save by the MPAA).

They were helped by those who went before and the fact the demand was there, as it always had. Once people knew they wanted what was on offer.
