As a child I was traumatised by TV shows on Nature. I loved them of course, but most shows always had that moment when the cute baby antelope, meerkat, whale (whatever) was going to get torn apart by some evil predator.

I my naive world this was not fair (and terrifying). How could the nice man just sit there behind his camera calmly describing the unfolding horror? Stop that evil wolf! Please (sob). That cameraman is evil. He is complicit in the evil of the wolf.

When I asked (tearfully) why the man didn't stop the wolf, (lion, whatever), the answer was shocking. "That's Nature. We shouldn't intervene. The wolf needs to eat too." Later I learnt that this was the exact reason the world is so rich and varied.

_If you are too slow, too stupid, too weak, you get eaten or starve. Simple._

To a child this is shocking; intervention sounds the very right thing to do. But it is naive, not seeing the wider and hugely complex picture. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions", should read, "interventions", _naive interventions._

So it sounds a great idea to save a company from bankruptcy, to stop them being eaten by the wolf. Stop the job losses, stop the ripple of effects to suppliers. But what if keeping that company afloat sinks a nascent start-up from succeeding? Without the death of one business, the market gap it creates is absent so it cannot feed another new business.

Intervention happens all the time and the bigger the company, the bigger the chance of intervention, because, "we can't afford for them to die." Sounds familiar?

Is it my naivety that baulked at saving the numerous [banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank) from failure, those that created the latest global financial shambles? Or was it the naivety of the government interventionists? Five years on from the panic, I'm betting on the latter.

Banks sound poor performers when you think about the huge amount of supporting regulation and legislation needed to prop them up. Internally they are the precise Old Days corporations that would typically deserve to die: lacking volatility, innovation and agility. Too slow, too stupid, too weak. Let's do evil here! Sure they make huge profits; but they are the House bet in a crooked casino. Frankly, we should only be amazed that they make so little profit!

So, do some evil, be complicit with the wolf. _Let them die._ Or at least test the Old Days assumption that letting them die would be disastrous In fact that has already happened. Some banks did die; they sank so quickly nothing could be done in time to bail them out.

Why then, if some banks failed and the results were not manifestly more disastrous, did we not let all those others sinking do so without bailing them out?

Firstly, fear. The random events that collided to cause the crisis in the first place came together quickly and in a way not predicted (without hindsight). What if _not_ intervening worsened the situation? Secondly, the banks lobbied and pleaded their survival case with the ultimate weapon - emotion. They supported their claim to survival with emotional response, rather than any empirical evidence or logic.

_They played on our first (and strongest) response - **fear**. _

I still want to save that baby meerkat from that evil jackal though.
