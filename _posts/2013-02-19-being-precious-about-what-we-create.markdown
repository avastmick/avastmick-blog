I don't tweet much. I email rarely. Overall I leave an information footprint lower than many. Probably less than I should, given those who know me always go on that I have so much to say. Generally.

Most people over-share, are noisy. This leads to loss. Loss of the good stuff. Loss of real information. Relevant here is the advice given to me years ago; it still affects me today.

Tony was a gruff man who taught me how to make ceramic pots. He cautioned me strongly about waste, ensuring that everything I made was worthy before I sent it into the kiln to make it into an object that _could_ last forever. "Make sure what you create is worthy of being left to the ages", he said.

In the Old Days much of what we communicated, to each other or wider, was ephemeral. Conversations were quickly forgotten; paper letters were thrown away (unless you were famous); newspapers used for your evening fish and chips; books lost in secondhand book markets or library archives. Phone calls were unrecorded (unless you were a reputable gangster). Even many old TV shows and movies have been lost, their film deteriorated beyond viewing while in storage.

The Internet changed all that. It does to the content we create what the kiln did to my inept clay musings: it makes the most inane utterance a hard pot shard of data that will possibly live on forever. Content creators should really follow Tony's advice and first check that their creations are good enough to be shared in the first place.
