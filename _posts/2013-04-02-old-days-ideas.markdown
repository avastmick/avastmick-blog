Many people, when pressed, will express the opinion that the Old Days held some core of values or set of ideas that we would be foolish to disregard. They state that the long term ideologies of our time have at their base a set of ideals that are intrinsic to our very being and if disregarded we lose a great deal; that we ourselves would be lost without them.

In a [previous post](http://avastmick.org/2013/03/12/fear-of-the-new/) I indirectly challenged this viewpoint, stating that only the fear of not clearly seeing an alternative leads us to support the past's thinking.

_There is very little from the past I would like taken into the future without considerable thought first._

To reiterate this (and openly challenge people): **because something has been with us for a long time does not mean it has _any_ value to us. **Let's look at some examples to reinforce this point.


#### **Let's eat**


For millennia mankind was a cannibal species. At a push, it still is. It was a fundamental part of the greater part of our history. Let's not be coy here: man was eating man for longer than he has not.

So, by the consensus that idea or action that is long lived is "better", a more proven idea than one than more recently adopted, we should be all cannibals.

Why is cannibalism a bad thing? Beyond the obvious of being eaten oneself, why would we so vehemently deter it? Cannibalism seems to die out once larger societies arise and isolated hunter gatherer communities collide more often. It is a long argued point on why it died out, but the effects within a large society would be considerable. The immediate benefits that eating ones own species can give in order to survive the savage wild are quickly outweighed by the (moral) disadvantage to a larger society. If cannibalism still thrived in our society the typical suspicions of a neighbour would not be limited to whether they are intending to steal your stuff, or impregnate your wife, they may well be eyeing _you_ up for a feast where you are the main course.


#### **Spare the rod, spoil the child (or woman)**


Longer than we have eaten each other (just) we have also physically beaten the young (and female) of our species.

It was seen as a just thing to do. Even today parents in less enlightened parts of the world argue to retain the right to physically punish their offspring (and women). But it is on the decline. It is roundly seen as a bad thing to do to your children and to women. What gives a man (yes it is generally a man) a right to physically abuse a child or woman? Outside the confines of a few ancient texts, logically none. There is no manifest (logical) difference in the rights of one man to another and this extends to women and children equally.


#### **Eye for an eye**


Recently, in [Saudi Arabia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia) seven young men [were sentenced to be crucified](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/05/saudi-seven-crucifixion-armed-robbery) for robbing jewellery stores across the country. _Crucified_. Hung up on frames, outstretched by their arms until they drown in their own juices or are taken down and shot for taking to long to do so. [Later, the sentence was "reduced" to beheading ](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57573995/beheadings-not-crucifixion-for-alleged-saudi-thieves/)as an act of clemency by the Saudi King

[Capital punishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment), even those forms labelled "humane" (I truly struggle with that), is on the wane. In another century I suggest that it will be in the same (cooking) pot as cannibalism (and beating children) as grotesque spots on our history.


#### **Civilisation**


In [Steven Pinker's](http://www.stevenpinker.com/) book,Â _[The Better Angels of Our Nature](http://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence),_ the many ways man has dealt out violence to man throughout history is wonderfully described. This violence has subsequently diminished (much to many's surprise). We are continually civilising ourselves and making for a better world. We are doing this mostly by trimming away the (cruel) practises of the past, of the Old Days.

It doesn't stop. There are many things we do today that are widely thought acceptable and only cranks and lunatics would point out the ill nature of them; these cranks are generally laughed at. In a century will our children's children think on us as cruel? Most likely. Will they be cranks? Unlikely.

_This is progress. Not the dogma from a poorly translated text that is many hundreds of years old. That is not progress. It is stagnation. Progress is each generation challenging the thoughts, ideas and actions of the previous.
_

Comfort could be had from Pinker's book. I liked the first part more than the rest however, as indicated by [another recent post](http://avastmick.org/2013/03/25/living-on-the-precipice-of-doom/). We should be cautious about overly applauding man's efforts to date. There is still a long way to go. The fear of things is driving us on to improve our lot.
