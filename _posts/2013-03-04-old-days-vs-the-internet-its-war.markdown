I want to spell this out. _We are at war!_

Maybe it's a kind of [phoney war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War), non-militaristic, say nothing like that is being bloodily played out in [Syria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria) or [Mali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali). But it is a war nonetheless.

_And people will die._

Okay, perhaps I am going overboard. But everything is _WAR_ these days. The [War on Drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs); the [War on Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror); [Cyberwar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare); IP War. War on double parking (okay I made that last one up, but you get what I'm saying).

The point I am making is thatÂ [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) institutions use "war" to instil sufficient emotion into whatever argument they are putting forward so that _logic and reason_ is disregarded. In reality "war" in the contexts used above is meaningless. Save that guns may be (often) used to settle the argument.

So, how about we take this rhetorical approach to our aims.


<blockquote>Listen people, we are fighting the War on Privacy.

We are fighting (erm, against) the War on [Internet Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship).</blockquote>


Hmmm, this doesn't quite seem to work. We seem to be always on the wrong side somehow. Cleverly, the [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) proponents are mostly mounting their wars "_on_" a problem. They are the aggressor, they hold the sword of Retribution. Like an [Old Testament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament) avenger they will cleanse the world of evil; they are the Just; they will deal out Justice in their righteous quest.

We, on the other hand, are defending; our rhetoric is defensive (passive). We are meek, holding a shield defying the aggressor.

It does seem rhetoric is best played from a position of moral strength, the high ground. It just sounds better to bluster blood n' guts to get your point across. Appealing to ones better nature just doesn't work as well.

What we do need to do is to be careful we don't sound like a bunch of whining sissies; or (worse) sound like hapless idealists.
