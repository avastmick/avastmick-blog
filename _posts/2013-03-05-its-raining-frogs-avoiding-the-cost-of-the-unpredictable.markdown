[![It's raining frogs! Better prepare.](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/buildfr.jpg)](http://avastmick.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/buildfr.jpg)


It's raining frogs and your business is over!

You are a seller of frogs. You supply the froggy demand of people, businesses and government. You do not have exclusive rights to supply, but you and a small set of other suppliers have the frog market tied up and business is good, it is lucrative.

Until today. Today there are frogs everywhere, in huge numbers. People just have to pick them up. For free. You are out of business; all your stock is worthless and that big loan you just took out for the stock required to qualify for that big All of Government contract is going to sink you. You are (were) running an [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) business that was too small to viably control its environment; you were too small for the government to say, "Frogs Inc are too big to fail, no one can use free frogs, they must first be accredited by Frog Inc. as safe to use." That didn't and wouldn't happen.

You always thought that raining frogs would never happen, that it would be so unlikely. But it did. Today.

[Nassim N Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) termed events like this [Black Swans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book)) (not frogs) . Large unpredictable events that have huge impact. Like when it rains frogs to you a frog merchant.

Yesterday, before today's downpour, what could you have done to isolate yourself from the potential impact of frogs being everywhere, for free?

Insurance may have helped. You could have insured yourself against the event at least covered your debts. _But I hope you checked the small print, the policy may not be honoured as frog precipitation may be classified an Act of God!_

Better again, would be for you to have had a back-up option, say shovels. Shovels would be useful in the Frogpocalypse aftermath, to clean up the mess. They are also a reasonable longterm commodity: easy to store; no best before date; always some level of demand.

Taleb calls this protection, optionality. You have options against the Black Swan (Frog) event. You can offset your large scale risk of having only one lucrative line of business (selling frogs in a low frog-saturated market) by diversifying at low risk (shovels are always somewhat in demand), then when frogs are (literally) everywhere you may make enough to get by.

To mitigate your risk almost entirely (almost - remember we can't predict other cataclysmic events), it would have been even better to take insurance, buy shovels, buy dissection kits for schools, take evening classes to train as a meteorologist, write a blog and a book. The best course would have been to have a set of options (and not take that loan). Then come the day you should be covered.

These low risk, low cost options should offer the possibility of sufficient return to tide you over. And as Taleb states one may even pay back big due to a positive Black Swan. As likely as raining frogs would be the government mandating the personal ownership of shovels; or all schools introducing compulsory frog dissection classes.

_Maybe people will read your blog and like it enough to buy your book too._
