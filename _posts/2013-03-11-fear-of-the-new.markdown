_“The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.” [JM Keynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes), 1935_

In many ways, Keynes was a father (among many) of Internet thinking. He got the fact that the New (as ideas) drives us forward and will solve many of our problems. Interestingly too is that he has been made an [Old Days](/2013/02/21/old-days/) figure; various dogmatic interpretations of [Keynesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) thought (in economics) has led to many of today's problems (real or perceived).

The past gave us a lot of ideas that have stayed with us. Many of these have outlived their welcome, yet we cling to them, not because they have any merit or value, but because the alternative is terrifying. **We fear the unknown.**

The problem with this kind of fear is it removes rationality from the picture. Once fear takes hold, we are unable to think clearly and to see the best options to take; we then reinforce our position and entrench ourselves further in the _status quo._

I truly believe that the act of looking forward and not back alleviates this fear. _This is important._ Rather than looking back, we need to test what ideas we have today against only what we need to progress (and no more). Quite often what we need to progress is change. Without change there is only death. For change we need the right fuel for it: new ideas.

I think this is a subtly hard concept. Looking back, insistently relying on old ideas, is an attempt to predict the future through a dogmatic lens. It can only serve to preserve the status quo. Looking back cannot bring fresh ideas or change. It is reinforcing behaviour - ramifying what we have inherited from the past, not enhancing our ability to cope with whatever the future throws our way.

The thing is, old ideas are not really old - not really. Our experiences revise the past, tweaking it, tinkering with it so it (still) works today. This is good. Old ideas, plain old ideas aren't the problem, as Keynes noted. The problem is something else. Often old ideas have been adulterated in a certain way, _ramif[ied]_, as Keynes put it. These old ideas are invested with dogma, a central ethos, that is so strong to us that it undermines any attempt at building out something newer. This is Old Days thinking. It is circular, like a snake eating its own tail for nourishment; thinking that is leading us nowhere.

Old Days thinking makes us attempt to predict a (unpredictable) future by looking at the ideas of the past in order to overemphasise the future significance of those old ideas that buttress the Old Days thinking. (See, subtly hard!)

Old Days _thinking_ (not ideas) identifies itself in two ways. One, that an idea is so (morally) virtuous it must be retained at **all** cost in the future (hence the need for prediction). Two, that if a virtuous idea is found to be not _virtuous_ it is entirely worthless and should be thrown out and replaced with a more virtuous idea (however all that is measured evades me).

This kind of thinking scales from the smallest promotion of an idea, to those ideas that support the ethos of whole countries and world spanning religions. This thinking has a preciousness of thought, "My idea is so great that everyone should share it." And here lies the danger. These ideas, steeped in virtue and emotion, are hard to break from.

To break from this, to improve upon the past, we should allow some of its most significant structures to crumble and fall down. We should just let ideas that have lost their immediacy and usefulness just fade away. That way we have an agility of _thinking_ that will cope with whatever the future may hold without needing (or desiring) to predict precisely what that future will hold.

_Fear of the New, of the Unknown, comes from Old Days thinking._

The Internet, my trope for everything that is _not_ Old Days thinking, doesn't work like that. Internet thinking isn't into defending an idea just because it has been about for a long time and a lot of people have (overly) invested in it; ideas have no intrinsic virtue. Nor is it into throwing the baby out with the bath water, replacing one dogma with another to retain the _status quo_.

Let's not follow Old Days thinking and be fearful of new ideas. Let's tinker, change, rework without actually feeling we have to either support any special part of the idea (dogma), nor feel we have to introduce a new special part (dogma) to it. Let the old ideas gently retire. When something has had its day, let it go, acknowledge it worked at some point (or didn't). It once had some value: we learnt from it. That's good enough. Emotion doesn't come into it.

Life all around us shows us this way of behaviour. Nature loves change, constant change over a long timeframe. Nature is a ruthless enforcer of change in the long-term, not the short. There are no endogenous (and short-term) revolutions. Things (species) just fizzle out in the face of the fitter, the faster, the smarter. Nature does not conduct a vindictive ideological cleansing of species. They either function well and thrive, or struggle and die out. _They do so in the long-term._ There is no blame, no virtue, no emotion in Nature. She dishes out change for all on equal terms. Like (true) Justice, Nature wears a blindfold.

Revolutions do occur - exogenous events like colliding comets may disrupt a successful hierarchy of species like dinosaurs. But the same rules apply. Your species is either suited to survival or it is not. Again, there is no dogma in play, no ideology to prescribe the path taken.

There are no gaps in Nature; "Nature abhors a vacuum", as the saying goes. If a gap appears, it is filled quickly; a gap is simply an opportunity. Old Days thinking creates the fear of a vacuum, a gap; yet Old Days thinking is full of the gaps and holes of unfulfilled progress. Avoid that kind of thinking and we can avoid fear. Avoid attributing (worthless) "virtues" to ideas and ideas will be just ideas.

_There will be no "New" ideas to be fearful of, just Ideas._
