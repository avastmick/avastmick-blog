_Just because something has been done for a long time doesn't mean it was ever a good idea._

Being unfettered in your thinking will enable the possibility of ideas and innovation. However, being open and available to _any_ kind of thinking is not as acceptable as one might think and there are many means to constrain it. Nostalgia is a commonplace means to constrain our thinking and along with sentimentality it seems to seep into our thinking without the slightest nudge to conscious thought.

__Nostalgia and_ Sentimentality - keeping things as they've been since time immemorial._

Change is inevitable however: either you embrace it and gain from it, or you are washed away by it. Nothing is immune from this, even those things we hold most dear and true; those things we sentimentalise or have nostalgia for.

**Breaking free of emotion to see things as they really are**

A good example of being blinded by emotion on a topic is the countryside - rural life. I was born and raised outside of a city. My earliest memories were of roaming the fields in search of adventures, free upon a background of green. Miles from the nearest town we entertained ourselves by simple things - we were never bored, as I recall.

We all have in our ancestral roots rural living. We have all dreamt the dream of the country idyll: that there life is simpler, more wholesome and freer than our city lives. In the country the pace of life is slower, people have more time and are more pleasant. We have dreamt of a [green and pleasant land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time) as if [Arcadia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia) were real with barn dances, village fetes and cream teas.

_Rural life is a myth_.

The concept that people live more simply and contentedly in the country than they do in cities is a fraud. Country people are (generally) poorer, less educated, have fewer opportunities than their city cousins.

The tinge of green covers up far more than supposedly sinister corporations who profit from our exploitation.

The rural places that people actually live in are sited on old industrial landscapes, places of exploitation, pollution and over-production. But in the lifetime of a single man Nature can reclaim the landscape and return it to a seemingly pristine condition worthy of state protection. The very things that brought people to live there - industry, work and opportunity - have long gone. Those places are far enough from any urban sprawl that there is no reasonable means to live there - too far to commute to - and so the community ages and dies.

All of this means fewer and fewer people live in the countryside. As the last manufacturing industry is removed all that remains is an agriculture increasingly mechanised and made efficient. There is nothing left for people to do there, no means to live. There is no practical reason for people to be there beyond a dream-filled visit - as infrequent tourists.

All this is seen as a huge loss. It feels, as we read about it, a shameful waste as if we are surrendering the rural souls of us all. We mourn the passing as if something good is being lost.

Any change to the rural landscape, itself less than a man's lifetime old, and all hell breaks loose: emotional protests, calls to politicians, dung dumped on the steps of City Hall. We weep for the loss of Arcadia. We mourn the passing of a simpler life.

In fact, small rural towns are actually modern remnants of feudal living: where rich landowners lord over itinerant merchants and penniless peasants. By any rational modern measure we should be celebrating the depopulation of the countryside, not mourning it.

Why do we mourn for it then? Misplaced sentimentalism, certainly not rational thinking. What are we mourning for? A myth. We are confused; we confuse green with Green; we confuse rural living with nature and life.

If our concern is ecological the depopulation of the countryside is overwhelmingly good. Across Europe for example, large tracts of land have been returned to forest and wilderness, increasing bio-diversity. Contrast that with the remaining areas of heavy agriculture that are polluted with nitrates and undermined by soil erosion.

If our concern is the loss of some lost rural culture, it never existed. Man has scraped an existence from the soil for millenia, only since we moved into cities have we found any level of comfort in our lives. The wretched story told of the movement of peasants from field to dark satanic mill in the recent past was actually (overall) a movement for good; breaking your back in a field or in a factory, it's all the same; it's in the factory, in the city, that you have options and opportunities however hard the job is at hand. Contrast this with the wretched life of the country peasant that has been unchanged for millennia with no options nor opportunity.

Don't get me wrong, I like the countryside. In fact, I've moved back there as an adult to raise my kids, to let them roam the green fields and have adventures. I love the open green spaces, the forests and rivers. I like the views from mountains and the obvious passing of seasons. I like my suburbanised rural life, where my few acres act as an antidote to my desk-bound day job.

What I don't like is the **lie**: people aren't happier or more content in Arcadia because Arcadia does not exist. In the main rural inhabitants are poor and disenfranchised.

The migration occurring across the globe, where people leave the countryside for the riches and opportunities of the city, has been in progress for hundreds of years. It is a natural thing, adhering to the Law of Nature.

The countryside will survive without our sentimental and nostalgic intervention. It does not need subsidy, grant and bias. And those poor occupants of non-Arcadia we hope to help stay there would not benefit from any hand outs as that remnant Old Days feudal system in place there would not allow it, the money would go elsewhere as it always has.

No, new thinking is needed. Rather than give misplaced incentives to keep people in places they get little or nothing from living in, instead free them up to go elsewhere, without shame or loss.

I'm pretty sure that most people reading this would somehow disagree; they would argue that while rural life is generally poor for those living it, somehow they are richer for it; they would argue that all of man's advancement in cities has come at a horrible cost.

The basis of these arguments is emotional. It is based on concepts such as the well-being of our souls, or spirituality: concepts that bring little material comfort to those in need.
