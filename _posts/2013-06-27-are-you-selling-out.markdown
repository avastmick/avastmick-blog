Ideology, culturalism, morality are all dimensions of the same malaise:Â society instructing people how to live their lives, not through logic, compromise and rational thinking, but through force, shame and belief.

We maybe living in a time that challenges the way society traditionally controls its population, where we turn over a history of utilising a moral stick (or cudgel) and move towards a commercial carrot. While many bemoan consumerism as morally threadbare, surely it is better than the cruel coercion of the Old Days, surely consumerism is better for us all?

Me? I'm selling out, I'm putting my faith in the power of purchase to bring a better society, what about you?
