In [another post](http://avastmick.org/2013/02/28/volatile/) I raged against the Old Days and how they generally disadvantaged the economic engine of the Internet age: the consumer.

The 20th century saw a radical departure from the jealous guarding of information by the elite and the careful curation of commodity by the few, to a free-for-all of information and practically endless supply of stuff brought by the Internet.

A [fine sport story on the BBC ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22466795)oddly highlighted to me how recent this all was. The story of [Dave Whelan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Whelan), entrepreneur, football club owner and ex-player illustrated beautifully how far we have come and how much opportunity there is in embracing change. The story, on the one hand, is a classic tale of symmetry. Dave was tragically denied glory at the pinnacle of his career when injured in the [FA Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final). He then helped transform the retail business in the UK, first introducing US-style supermarkets then later sports outlets that we know today. It made him rich. He bought a football club ([Wigan Athletic](http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk)), invested in it, nurtured it; he raised it from the lower leagues in a rags to riches story that culminated in winning the FA Cup.

_Okay, great story, but what's my point? _

Just that Dave's story is so recent, really. In the Old Days the general means of selling to consumers was where a counter stood between the goods for sale and the person wanting to buy them. Dave and his ilk ended this replacing it with a model where people could actually chose themselves what they wanted, without the intervention of a shopkeeper. Dave sold his original stores and made himself rich in 1978. Only 35 years ago a person could make themselves very rich from selling a small set of local supermarkets that took 10 years to build.

Counter-based shops and stores were the mainstay (or the only way) of consumerism for hundreds of years. These were only a slight elaboration of the market, or bazaar, that were the retail outlets of millennia. Dave make his millions in a revolution that only began 50 years ago and ended 10 years ago.

Ten (10) years ago the revolution was itself being revolutionised. The Internet made consumption even more self-service, even more egalitarian in choice to the consumer.

Two levels, adapt and change, and empower the customer. Self service.

Old Days service is "on you behalf". Sounds good, but in reality is closing down your options, removing freedom.
