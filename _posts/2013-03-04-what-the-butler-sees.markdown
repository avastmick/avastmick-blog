I'm pretty sure you would have seen at least one movie version of [Dumas'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas) _[Count of Monte Cristo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo)_. The scene I like is where the (newly minted) Count throws the most spectacular ball. It is the epitome of opulence: fireworks, masks, balloons, servants, music and food. All played out in front of the Count's fabulous chateau.

Keep the scene in your mind and imagine you are there. Through luck or influence, you have been invited. You have dressed yourself in suitable attire and are wearing a suitably fashionable mask.

You move through the excited throngs, past servants offering delicious canapés and champagne; you travel inside the mansion (with champagne in hand) and move to the Ball Room. Fantastic music drifts through the walls; shadows and light play in beautiful patterns through the gap at the bottom of the door. But the doors are shut. The Butler of the chateau is seen gazing through the key hole.

Amazing. This is why you are here. You want to join in the ball, you really want to join the dance. But you are intimidated. First you really want to know what dance they are doing so you are prepared and reduce your risk of looking foolish. Let's say (for argument) reputation is all here - it is the ticket to success. Wow the party-goers in the Ball Room and the door opens to other opportunities and fame and fortune follows. Like the Count himself, you are selling yourself or the idea of yourself, but you do not have the means (money) like he does to bankroll immediate acceptance.

To reduce your risk, you feel you need to utilise some expertise to help. The Butler looks like he fits the bill.


<blockquote>What can you see, Butler? Tell me about the dance. What are the steps? How does it look? Is it complex?

I can only see a small section of the hall, sir, but I am confident of my knowledge. For a small sum I could advice sir of what to do.</blockquote>


The Butler is your expert. He has seen the dance through the keyhole. Only the slightest glimpse, but more than you have. You have to trust his expertise, his knowledge, don't you?. He does have something you really want: _a sight of the Ball Room, a sight of the dance._

The Butler is an [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) figure. An expert selling the most meager of understanding. True he does know more than you, but his view is only the tiniest of slices across the Ball Room. He is then either telling you exactly what he sees (little value), or extrapolating from what he sees into a predicted vision of the whole (perceived value).

The latter is the only area worth exploring (if at all). The former could be achieved by roughly pushing him aside and looking yourself. Unless this is really [Old Days](http://mickclarke.org/2013/02/21/old-days/) and such an act was impossible and _expertise_ was protected and sacred. What can he actually see? It could just be people in the dance; it could just be servants with trays of canapés or champagne; it could be the band; it could be people watching, not dancing. His view is fully without context; he is a predictor of a complex scene, highly prone to error.

The first question you could have asked then was not 'What can you see?', but "Have you ever been in the Ball Room during a dance?' Is the Butler's experience based on direct experience through participation, or on observation only? You need to know what the context of his advice is.

You cannot be sure of the exact dance, but you could draw on the experience of someone who actually danced _a_ dance in the Ball Room. This has _some_ value to you at least. There needs to be caution though, the expert may have danced a [Viennese Waltz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_Waltz) at his Ball; today the Ball Room rocks the [Jitterbug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug). Expert opinion and judgement is a risky proposition to follow.

_So how do we solve the problem? How do we join the Dance? **Without everyone laughing and you losing reputation and maybe more.**_

The simplest is to just go in. To open the door, take a deep breath and join. Why wouldn't you do that?

To assess the bold step you need to assess how equipped you were for the plunge and what you would lose if you didn't pull it off. If you've got good skills; you have experience in a number of dances and (importantly) can improvise and think well on your feet; you should be well placed to take the risk.

You could offset your risk by staying at the edge, only tentatively stepping to the tune of the dance. A misstep would only we noticed by a small proportion of the Ball Room, the laughter would be minimal. You could exit without losing too much.

You may line up another ball tomorrow, if you have sufficient means to pay for another outfit, maybe another mask. Blow up at this Ball, tomorrow's may more favour your dancing skills. In this case barge into the middle: own the Ball Room. Maybe be so bold as to change the dance completely. Pull it off and you are made, the upside being so great that you could play tomorrow's ball safely knowing reputation is secure. However, clear the floor leaving no more than laughter and derision and at least you can play your hand again tomorrow.

You could do neither, you could look about for other discrete vantage points, at windows, at other key-holes; or interview other experts. All the while the clock runs down to midnight, all the time the energy of the Ball diminishes. The Ball always end at midnight, yes?

Finally, you could step back and not go in. Go outside and watch the fireworks, anonymous behind your mask. Leave others to the glory of dance.

What to do? I can't say (I am not an expert), all I know is there are options. You can expand or reduce your options. At least go to the Ball in the first place? At least think about joining in.
