#### 1. We are all ruled by the Laws of Nature




<blockquote>

> 
> 
	
>   1. Adapt,
> 
	
>   2. Innovate or
> 
	
>   3. Die.
>

#### 2. Wealth breeds Innovation

<blockquote>

> 
> 
	
>   1. Time,
> 
	
>   2. Resource and
> 
	
>   3. Collaboration.
> 

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

> 
> 
	
>   1. Trust,
> 
	
>   2. Convention and
> 
	
>   3. Ideology.
>
