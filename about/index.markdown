_There's always a better way, always._

This is what I believe.

And those who defend the status quo, those who represent the hegemony? Their goal is solely to defend their own interests. No more than that.

If we believe them, the "_experts_", where would the human race be? At best scratching an existence in a damp cave; at worst: extinct.

Let's not.
