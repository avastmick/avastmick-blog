We are living through revolutionary times. It's like the [1440](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg)s when the information tap was opened beyond a drip; this time it is gushing out. It's like the [1780](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution)s all over again and innovation is everywhere; future historians will be arguing over the _exact_ date it all began. This is now.

Every idea you hold now dear (and cling to as the truth) will be challenged; if it does not stand up to scrutiny it will not be in the future. It will be extinct.

That was the Old Days thinking, the future will be filled with Internet thinking.

_Old Days vs the Internet._

In simple terms this is comparing how things used to be done (in the Old Days), and how they are being done today, or rather how they should be done tomorrow (since the Internet). It is my trope for the change we are living through.

The Internet provides the counterpoint to how things are traditionally done (badly). Not because all things on the Internet are intrinsically excellent examples of how things should be done (because a lot of what the Internet is is rubbish), but because the Internet challenges theÂ **_status quo_**. Due to its nature it makes Old Days thinking look poor and highlights that there can be another way (even if that other way is worse).

I think the Internet in its original form is a force for overwhelming social good. It is, <del>without doubt</del> (possibly) the most significant invention mankind has made since the controlling of fire.

_The Internet has freed the individual from being passive; more people today have the opportunity to tackle any problem; more problems are going to be solved; more people have (instant) access to information. It is the lowest cost key to innovation in history, unlocking the three requirements - time, resource and collaboration.
_

To solve the world's problems we need **Internet thinking**, thinking that is organic, alive and embracing **volatility.** Thinking that is not retelling the past, applying false narrative, but looking to the unpredictable for strength. ****

I truly believe in the power of the unpredictable, in chance as a good thing, in change as the true indicator of being alive. I met my wife by chance, gained great jobs through accidental meetings. My life is the outcome of random. It is (relatively) successful because I (generally) embrace any positive opportunity, go with the flow, work out the best outcome.
